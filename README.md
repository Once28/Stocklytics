# StockMarket
## Inspiration
We were inspired by the recent stock market mania with gamestop and wallstreetbets. We wanted to see if there was a way to predict stock prices based on how often a stock is being mentioned on social media platforms such as reddit and twitter. 

## What it does
This platform provides users with how often a specific stock is mentioned on twitter and reddit and recent news articles about these specific stock. 

## How we built it
We built this platform using the tools in the R language and the dataset scraped from existing algorithms.  

## Challenges we ran into
Working with the reddit API was not only something that is new for our team, but also a challenging feat in our journey to accomplish our goal.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are most proud of our ability to integrate APIs and Datasets in Shiny while having both tools collaboratively supporting each other.

## What we learned
Through our experience in implementing the Reddit API, Newsanchor API, and multiple R libraries, we learned the importance of finding expertise as well as the value of being patient with solving issues in our code and among our team.

## What's next for Stocklytics
We have already started our next step in pursuing a machine learning algorithm that uses past trends to predict future trends based on the intentionality of mentions in social media platforms. We've already started building training models and implemented machine learning libraries in our code! The next step after that would be to open the platform to the public so that everyone has a fair change in predicting the future.
